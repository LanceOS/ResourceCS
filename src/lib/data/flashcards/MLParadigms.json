    "answer": "Supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where an algorithm learns from a training dataset that contains both input features and the correct output labels.

    "answer": "Reinforcement learning is a machine learning paradigm in which an **agent** learns to make decisions by taking actions in an **environment** to maximize a cumulative **reward**. It learns through a process of trial and error, receiving positive rewards for good actions and penalties for bad ones. The agent is not explicitly told what to do but instead learns from its experience.",

It is often used to train models when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming, as the model can learn from the unlabeled data to improve its understanding of the problem.",
