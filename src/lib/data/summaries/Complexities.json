The core idea is to count the number of 'elementary operations' an algorithm performs as a function of 'n'.\n\nThis measure is typically expressed using **Big O notation ($\\mathcal{O}$)**, which provides an **asymptotic upper bound** on the growth rate.

For example, if an algorithm has a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n)$, it means that its running time grows linearly with the size of the input.

This process involves several key steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Elementary Operations**: These are operations that take a fixed amount of time to complete, such as arithmetic operations ($+,-,*,/$), variable assignments, comparisons, and array lookups. Each of these is considered to take one 'unit' of time.\n\n2.  **Analyze Control Structures**: Examine loops and recursive calls. A single loop that runs 'n' times will contribute $n$ operations. A nested loop, where the inner loop runs 'n' times for each of the 'n' iterations of the outer loop, will result in $n \\times n = n^2$ operations.\n\n3.  **Form a Function**: Express the total count of operations as a function of 'n'. For example, an algorithm with a linear loop followed by a quadratic nested loop might have a function like $f(n) = 3n^2 + 10n + 5$.\n\n4.  **Apply Big O Notation**: This is the final and most critical step. You simplify the function by discarding constant factors and lower-order terms. The dominant term is the one that grows the fastest as 'n' becomes very large. In the example above, $n^2$ is the dominant term, so the time complexity is simplified to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. This is because, for large values of 'n', the $10n + 5$ part of the function becomes insignificant compared to the $3n^2$ part. ",

This often results in a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ or worse. If you see a nested loop, especially one iterating over a large dataset, it's a red flag.\n\n* **Poor Data Structure Choice**: Using the wrong data structure for a task can drastically increase complexity.

A linked list would be a better choice for this specific task, as it's an $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ operation.\n\n* **Repeated Calculations**: If the same expensive computation is being performed repeatedly inside a loop, it indicates a potential for optimization. You can often cache the result of the calculation outside the loop. This is especially true for recursive functions without **memoization**.\n\n* **Naive Algorithms**: Simple, brute-force solutions that check every possible combination often have very high complexities (e.g., exponential).
