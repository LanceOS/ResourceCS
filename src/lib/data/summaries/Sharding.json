Each shard operates as a separate database instance, with the data distributed across them. The main purpose of sharding is to improve the performance, scalability, and availability of a database by spreading the workload and data storage across multiple servers. This allows a system to handle larger volumes of data and more concurrent requests than a single database could on its own. ",

It's easy to implement but can lead to uneven data distribution and **hot spots** if certain ranges are more active.\n2.  **Hash-based Sharding**: A hash function is applied to a shard key (e.g., a user ID) to determine the shard. This provides a more even distribution of data, but it can make range-based queries less efficient as related data may not be located on the same shard.\n3.  **Directory-based Sharding**: A lookup table, or 'directory', maintains a mapping of shard keys to their corresponding shards. This offers the most flexibility, as it allows for dynamic re-sharding and can handle uneven data distribution, but it introduces a single point of failure at the directory level if not properly designed.
