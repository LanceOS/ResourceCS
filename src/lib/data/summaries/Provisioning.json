This includes installing the operating system, all required software and applications, and implementing security measures. It also involves configuring the server's network settings and storage.

      "body": "Horizontally scaled server architectures require **stateless** servers to be efficient and resilient. A stateless server doesn't store any session-specific data—such as user information, cookies, or temporary variables—on the server itself. This is crucial because it allows any server instance behind a load balancer to handle any incoming request. If a server were to fail, its 'state' is not lost because all essential data is stored externally (e.g., in a database or a shared cache). This design enables seamless **fault tolerance** and high **scalability**. You can add or remove servers from the pool without disrupting user sessions, as the new server can pick up where the old one left off, ensuring a consistent user experience. ",

It involves having duplicate or backup servers that are ready to take over the functions of a primary server in the event of a failure. The main goal is to eliminate any **single points of failure**, which are parts of a system that would cause the entire system to fail if they malfunction. By providing a backup system, redundancy minimizes downtime and ensures **high availability** and data protection. In a redundant setup, if one server goes down, the backup can seamlessly take over, often without any noticeable interruption to the end user. This is a crucial component of any robust disaster recovery and business continuity plan. ",

The passive server is a hot standby, synchronized with the active server, but it only becomes operational if the active server fails. This is a common and relatively simple approach to failover.\n\n* In an **active-active** setup, all servers are actively and simultaneously handling requests.

There are four main types of failover systems, each offering different trade-offs in terms of cost and speed of recovery: \n\n1.  **Cold Standby**: The backup system is completely offline and must be manually provisioned and started upon failure. This has the lowest cost but the longest recovery time. \n2.  **Warm Standby**: The backup is partially running and receives periodic updates from the primary system. It can take over more quickly than a cold standby, but there might be a small loss of recent data. \n3.  **Hot Standby (Active-Passive)**: The backup is a fully synchronized, operational replica of the primary system, ready for immediate failover. This ensures minimal downtime but is more expensive. \n4.  **Active-Active**: All systems are actively running and serving requests. If one fails, the load balancer simply directs traffic to the remaining servers, resulting in the quickest possible recovery. ",

      "body": "The **CAP Theorem**, also known as Brewer's Theorem, is a fundamental principle in distributed system design. It states that a distributed system can only guarantee a maximum of two out of three properties at any given time: \n\n* **Consistency**: All nodes in the system have the same, most up-to-date data. A read from any node will return the most recent write. \n* **Availability**: Every request receives a response, without a guarantee that the response contains the most recent write. The system is always available to serve requests. \n* **Partition Tolerance**: The system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss or failure of parts of the system. \n\nIn the event of a network partition (P), you are forced to choose between consistency and availability. You can design a system that sacrifices consistency for availability (AP system) or availability for consistency (CP system). Understanding this trade-off is critical for architects designing robust and scalable distributed systems. ",
